I'm currently a research assistant at Zayed University Dubai with (prof. Abdul Kadhim Hayawi)[https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9x-gX6sAAAAJ&hl=en] and voluntary researcher in Falcon project at CERN with prof. Sergei Gleyzer. 

I received my bachelor's degree from SGGS Institute of Engineering and Technology Nanded (India) in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. I completed my bachelor thesis at NTU Singapore titled "Night-time vehicle classification using unsupervised domain adaptation".

My research interest lies in machine learning, AI and physics. I am excited about the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in physics and astronomy.

I am looking for collaboration on projects related to the application of machine learning in quantum physics, astronomy.
