I am a research assistant at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence(MBZUAI, Abu Dhabi) under [Dr. Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/) and [Dr. Fahad Khan](https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home). My research has focused on using large-scale image-language models in continual learning.

I received my bachelor's degree from [SGGS Institute of Engineering and Technology](https://www.sggs.ac.in/) Nanded (India) in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. I completed my bachelor thesis at [NTU Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) titled "Night-time vehicle classification using unsupervised domain adaptation" with [prof. Lam Siew Kei](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/assklam/).

My research interest lies in machine learning, AI and physics. I am excited about the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in physics and astronomy.

I am looking for collaboration on projects related to the application of machine learning in quantum physics, astronomy.
