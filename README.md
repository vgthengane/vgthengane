I'm currently a research assistant at Zayed University Dubai with [prof. Abdul Kadhim Hayawi](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9x-gX6sAAAAJ&hl=en) and voluntary researcher in Falcon project at CERN with [prof. Sergei Gleyzer](http://sergeigleyzer.com/). 

I received my bachelor's degree from [SGGS Institute of Engineering and Technology](https://www.sggs.ac.in/) Nanded (India) in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. I completed my bachelor thesis at [NTU Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) titled "Night-time vehicle classification using unsupervised domain adaptation" with [prof. Lam Siew Kei](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/assklam/).

My research interest lies in machine learning, AI and physics. I am excited about the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in physics and astronomy.

I am looking for collaboration on projects related to the application of machine learning in quantum physics, astronomy.
